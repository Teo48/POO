~~exceptions package~~
--------------------
- Some exceptions that could occur during the game.

~~main package~~
--------------
 - Main
   Class that implements the game logic. Here we read the data from the input
   file, we create an instance of the map(using singleton pattern).

   The methods that actually executes the game is implemented here alongside
   the ones used for players' fights.

~~players package~~
-----------------
 - Some enums with needed constants.
 - HeroFactory
 	- Implementation of factory pattern for the players.
 - Class that describes a Hero from which the other 4 are going to be extended.

~~skills package~~
 - Some enums with needed constants.
 - Implementations of the skills each type of hero has using visitor pattern.

~~utils_package~~
 - Reader
   Class that implements methods for fast input parsing.
   It only implements parsing methods for Integers and Strings.
 
 - Map
   Singelton implementation of the game map.
 
 - Coordinates
   Class that implements a pair of coordinates.

~~FEEDBACK~~
An interesting homework that helped me to improve my git usage skills.
May the force be with you!
